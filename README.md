# Prosnottor (প্রশ্নোত্তর)

Prosnottor is a frontend for a Bengali language model that can answer questions 
from a given context paragraph. 


## Cool, where can I get the model? 

As you might have guessed, I don't have the brains to do NLP and/or Machine
Learning. Someone has given me the model to create an interface for it. If s/he 
decides to publish the model someday, I'll be happy to link it here. Thank you!
